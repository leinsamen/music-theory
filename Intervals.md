An interval represents the distant between two pitches/sounds (measured by semitones/half-note).

| Interval | Semitones |
|---|:-:|
|  Unison | 0  |
|  Minor 2nd | 1  |
|  Major 2nd | 2  |
|  Minor 3rd | 3  |
|  Major 3rd | 4  |
|  Perfect 4th | 5  |
|  Tritone*  | 6  |
|  Perfect 5th | 7  |
| Minor 6th  | 8  |
| Major 6th  | 9  |
| Minor 7th | 10  |
| Major 7th  | 11  |
|  Octave | 12  |

Fun note: pick a number that is easy to remember and use it as a stepping stone. For example, Captain Georg von Trapp (The Sound of Music) had 7 children, so 7 semitones = P5. From there you know that 8 semitones = minor 6th, and so on.
