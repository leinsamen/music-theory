The Circle of Fifths (clockwise) and Circle of Fourths (counter-clockwise) represent some of the most common chord progressions, i.e. going up/down Perfect Fifth (P5) or Perfect Fourth (P4).

Note that it also matters whether you are going to a higher pitch or lower pitch. From C to a high F is P4, but it is P5 if going to a low F.

Although a mnemonic (e.g. Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battles) might initially be a useful device, it will greatly help you mastering other materials if you know these intervals and be able to recognize them fast by heart.

Goals: be able to know what is the P5 of ...; what is the P4 of ...
